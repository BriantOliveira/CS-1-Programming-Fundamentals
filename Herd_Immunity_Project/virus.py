class Virus(object):
    '''
    _____Attributes______:

    name: String.  The name of the virus.

    mortality_rate: Float between 0 and 1.  Represents the percentage chance that
        a person infected with this virus will die from this infection.

    basic_repro_num:  Float between 0 and 1.  Represents the average number of people a person
    will infect during the course of their illness.

    NOTE: For simplicity's sake, this simulation will assume that basic_repro_num is
    based on the number of infections spread out of contacts with 100 people from
    the larger population over the course of the infection.  This is an over-simplification
    of how basic reproduction number works, but it will do for our program.

    _____Methods_____

    __init__(self, name, mortality_rate, basic_repro_num)
        - All attributes are passed as parameters and set at instantiation.
